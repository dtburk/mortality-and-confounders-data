This script downloads data from the United Nations'
[World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/) website and 
saves it to the "downloaded_data" directory. The date at the top of the .html 
version of this file indicates the last time the data were downloaded.

```{r}
library(readr)
data_url <- "https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Files/1_Indicators%20(Standard)/CSV_FILES/WPP2019_PopulationByAgeSex_Medium.csv"
data <- read_csv(data_url)
if (!dir.exists("../downloaded_data")) dir.create("../downloaded_data")
write_csv(
  data, 
  path = paste0("../downloaded_data/age-dist-", Sys.Date(), ".csv")
)
```
